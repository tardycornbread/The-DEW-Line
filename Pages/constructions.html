            <br>June 1995</br>
            
            <br>The DEW Line - acronym for Distant Early Warning Line - is a chain of radar stations installed north of the Arctic Circle extending 3,000 miles from the Bering Strait in the west to the eastern shore of Baffin Island. Conceived in 1952, its purpose was to provide United States and Canada the earliest possible warning of subsonic aircraft and missiles approaching North America from the polar region.</br>
            <br>In the early stages of the Cold War with the Soviet Empire, Russian military planes were known to be flying reconnaissance missions over Alaska and deep into central Canada.  Detection of these was, at best, random but the fact of these intrusions was well known and was occasionally the subject of articles in the press. (I recall one in the New York Times circa 1950.)</br>
            <br>At the request of USAF, a group of scientists convened at MIT in 1952 to evaluate the potential threat to national security and make recommendations for countermeasures.  From this came the concept of the DEW Line. It required pushing the envelope of several technologies well beyond the (then) current state of the art.</br>
            <br>Contributing to the enormity of the task were the innumerable unknowns of geography (sketchy or nonexistent topographical data), climatology (temperature ranges, wind directions and velocities, precipitation), soil conditions (permafrost depth, availability of gravel, subsurface soil conditions), and oceanography (ice conditions, water depth, and currents which would affect the seaborne delivery of cargo). A fair amount was known of the north slope of Alaska. The U.S. Navy had established an arctic research lab at Pt. Barrow and had conducted extensive exploration for oil and gas in that area since 1946. In the Canadian arctic, information was spotty. There was a WWII paved airstrip and hangar at Frobisher Bay on Baffin Island (below the Arctic Circle).</br>
