            <br>To save time and maintain control, the procurement of all construction material designed for the Project was done within Project Office. From the beginning, we required our NE design firms to prepare detailed bills of material as their designs evolved. Using this data, we developed a coding and marking system for each and every item procured and shipped. In a reiterative process, my expediters, together with purchasing agents in the Procurement Division, prepared lists to cover every item according to class of material and site destination.</br>
            
            <br>The general construction contract was awarded to a joint venture: one firm with Alaska experience and the other who had previously worked for WECo. The Contractor had responsibility to determine his own office and on-site needs and to develop a logistic plan to support himself in the field.

        </br>
            
            <br>At that time there was, in the U.S., very little technical reference material about arctic construction. At Pt. Barrow, the Navy had used only crude adaptations of surplus war material. The only text sources on permafrost were Russian and many had not been translated to English. On the other hand, our design consultants could draw on their 1951 experience at the Thule, Greenland AFB. One of our unknowns was about summer rain and lightning. In the absence of data, we provided lightning protection and waterproof construction joints. It was a good precaution – we needed them.</br>

            <br>At the request of USAF, a group of scientists convened at MIT in 1952 to evaluate the potential threat to national security and make recommendations for countermeasures.  From this came the concept of the DEW Line. It required pushing the envelope of several technologies well beyond the (then) current state of the art.</br>
            <br>Contributing to the enormity of the task were the innumerable unknowns of geography (sketchy or nonexistent topographical data), climatology (temperature ranges, wind directions and velocities, precipitation), soil conditions (permafrost depth, availability of gravel, subsurface soil conditions), and oceanography (ice conditions, water depth, and currents which would affect the seaborne delivery of cargo). A fair amount was known of the north slope of Alaska. The U.S. Navy had established an arctic research lab at Pt. Barrow and had conducted extensive exploration for oil and gas in that area since 1946. In the Canadian arctic, information was spotty. There was a WWII paved airstrip and hangar at Frobisher Bay on Baffin Island (below the Arctic Circle).</br>
