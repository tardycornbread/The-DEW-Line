            <br>The Bell System was used to mobilizing task forces from its subsidiaries. I was invited to go to New York City the first week of 1953 to see if I would be interested in a special assignment (not explained) for a period of 6-12 months. It was there that I learned the nature of the project and that I was being offered the position of Building Engineer. I would be required to take temporary residence in New York City with trips home allowed alternate weekends. It was an intriguing challenge I was eager to accept and, with Marjorie‘s concurrence, did accept. I started work about a week later, which was as soon as I could hand over my Michigan Bell responsibilities and get my personal affairs arranged.</br>
            
            <br>In the beginning, the project office was in Western Electric Co. (WECo) Radio Division offices at 120 Broadway. I lived at the Roosevelt Hotel at Madison and 45th Street. From there I had easy underground access to the Lexington Avenue subway which had express service to lower Broadway. I worked six days a week except for (alternate) weekends home at Birmingham, Michigan.</br>
            
            <br>At that time there was, in the U.S., very little technical reference material about arctic construction. At Pt. Barrow, the Navy had used only crude adaptations of surplus war material. The only text sources on permafrost were Russian and many had not been translated to English. On the other hand, our design consultants could draw on their 1951 experience at the Thule, Greenland AFB. One of our unknowns was about summer rain and lightning. In the absence of data, we provided lightning protection and waterproof construction joints. It was a good precaution – we needed them.</br>

            <br>At the request of USAF, a group of scientists convened at MIT in 1952 to evaluate the potential threat to national security and make recommendations for countermeasures.  From this came the concept of the DEW Line. It required pushing the envelope of several technologies well beyond the (then) current state of the art.</br>
            <br>Contributing to the enormity of the task were the innumerable unknowns of geography (sketchy or nonexistent topographical data), climatology (temperature ranges, wind directions and velocities, precipitation), soil conditions (permafrost depth, availability of gravel, subsurface soil conditions), and oceanography (ice conditions, water depth, and currents which would affect the seaborne delivery of cargo). A fair amount was known of the north slope of Alaska. The U.S. Navy had established an arctic research lab at Pt. Barrow and had conducted extensive exploration for oil and gas in that area since 1946. In the Canadian arctic, information was spotty. There was a WWII paved airstrip and hangar at Frobisher Bay on Baffin Island (below the Arctic Circle).</br>
