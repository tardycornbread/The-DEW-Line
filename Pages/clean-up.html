            The DEWLine was conceptualized and built with meticulous attention to operational logistics over a span of 3,000 miles in the Arctic wilderness, involving the transportation of numerous fuel drums to the site. However, there was a glaring oversight in the planning process: no provisions were made for the retrieval or disposal of these drums, leading to their abandonment and contributing to environmental degradation in the Arctic.<br>

Initially, the operational life of the DEWLine was projected to last 15 years, and the environmental impact of leaving behind fuel barrels was significantly underestimated. Over time, as the operational needs extended beyond 30 years, with 27 stations still requiring fuel supply, the accumulated waste escalated into a major environmental concern.<br>

The transition of the DEWLine to the North Warning System led to the abandonment of buildings and sites, further exacerbating the environmental issues. The Cape Christian Loran station, though not a DEWLine facility, exemplifies the type of construction used and the subsequent accumulation of debris over the years.<br>

By around 1989, environmental assessments commenced, leading to the development of remediation plans. One of the first sites to undergo complete remediation was CAM-4, Pelly Bay, leaving behind only a commemorative plaque in a remote location.<br>

The remediation efforts for the DEWLine sites proved to be almost as costly as their construction, amounting to approximately $550 million. This expense underscores the financial and environmental costs of the Cold War. The remediation projects, however, also provided employment opportunities for indigenous peoples, mirroring their involvement during the construction and operational phases of the DEWLine.
